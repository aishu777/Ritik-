# AB-Testing-using-R-for-retargeting-Churn
Project to determine retargeting of churned customers and plans to pursue them using AB testing Approach in R

I. The Business Problem
Abandoned dataset is the data for all the customers in the dataset that were already pursued (advertised) but ended up not buying a vacation package.

Business Problem: Should we retarget those customers?

In light of the project, why this is a sensible business question?

Marketing is typically made up of 4P's (Price, Promotion, Product, Place). For a business strategy to be viable, this 4p's go hand in hand. 
These 4p's helps to figure out what a customer really wants.
This Projects Aims at one of the p i.e promotion of a holiday tour package. Typically a business unit carry out R & D and come out with a plan that profits the company by bolstering the need of the customers. In light of the business, it is important to determine why customers still churned. This real life data comes from team leada( Caliofornia based startup) who were attempting to solve the similar problem. 
This Project Helps the business to determine the preference of the customers at the same time to ascertain if the retargeting on them would still work but with a different campaign. Losing the customer loyalty is damaging anc this project adds value to save a lot of fortune by finding out if retargeting will belp retain the customers, bringing profitability to the business. 

An experiment is run, where customers in the abandoned dataset are randomly placed in a treatment or in a control group (see column L in both files).Those marked as “test” are retargeted (treated), the others marked as control are part of the control group.
